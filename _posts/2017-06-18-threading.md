<p>Say this main app wants to do a complex time consuming or dedicated task. Then it can start (not call as in subroutine) a function which will run in addition to the main app. This newly started function is called thread ( right side box code). Now both thread and main app code <g class="gr_ gr_166 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="166" data-gr-id="166">is</g> running in <g class="gr_ gr_165 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="165" data-gr-id="165">time</g> sharing mode on the processor.</p>

<p><g class="gr_ gr_146 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="146" data-gr-id="146">Single</g> thread is where there is only one thread that executes all task.

<h1></h1>
<h1>Hardware abstraction library (HAL)</h1>
<p>Ardupilot has their own HAL library, as seen by the AP. A hardware abstraction library is there for the users. It serves as a wrapper around the API (Application programming interface) to enhance the code's <g class="gr_ gr_135 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="135" data-gr-id="135">readibility</g> and the user's experience. It should not contain any "private" codes or <g class="gr_ gr_144 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="144" data-gr-id="144">background</g> thread. It should not contain the "how".</p>
<h1></h1>
<h1>The Timer Callbacks</h1>
<p>The code has a default timer function which is called at 1KHz (A very short amount of time as T=1/f). All registered timer functions are called sequentially. So each will be called after the previous one is completed. This mechanism is used as it is very <g class="gr_ gr_159 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="159" data-gr-id="159">portable,</g> and very useful. A timer callback can be registered by calling the scheduler, so <g class="gr_ gr_124 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="124" data-gr-id="124">hal</g>.scheduler-&gt;register_timer_process() as so: <g class="gr_ gr_125 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="125" data-gr-id="125">hal</g>.scheduler-&gt;register_timer_process(AP_HAL_MEMBERPROC(&amp;AP_Baro_MS5611::_update));</p>
<p>The AP_HAL_MEMBERPROC() macro provides a way to encapsulate a C++ member function as a callback argument (bundling up the object context with the function pointer). So uses a function as an argument to a callback, much like a parameter.</p>
<p>When a piece of code wants something to happen at less than 1kHz then it should maintain it&rsquo;s own &ldquo;last_called&rdquo; variable and return immediately if not enough time has passed. You can use the <g class="gr_ gr_127 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="127" data-gr-id="127">hal</g>.scheduler-&gt;millis() and <g class="gr_ gr_128 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="128" data-gr-id="128">hal</g>.scheduler-&gt;micros() functions to get the time since boot in milliseconds and microseconds to support this.</p>
<p>Should the piece of code wants something to happen at less than 1KHz, it should keep its own time and return immediately once its designated time has passed (Even if it's below 1KHz).</p>
<h1></h1>
<h1>HAL specific thread</h1>
<p>On platforms that support multiple threads, the AP-HAL will create threads to support basic operation. This depends entirely on the platform used.</p>
<p>For example, on PX4 the following HAL specific threads are created:</p>
<p>-The UART thread, for reading and writing UARTs (and USB)</p>
<p>-The timer thread, which supports the 1kHz timer functionality described above</p>
<p>-The IO thread, which supports writing to the microSD card, <g class="gr_ gr_152 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="152" data-gr-id="152">EEPROM</g> and FRAM</p>
<p>A common use of threads is to provide drivers a way to schedule slow tasks without interrupting the drone's flight.</p>
<h1></h1>
<h1>Driver specific threads</h1>
<p>It is also possible to create driver specific threads, to support asynchronous processing in a manner specific to one driver. <g class="gr_ gr_170 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="170" data-gr-id="170">Currently</g> you can only create driver specific threads in a manner that is platform dependent, so this is only appropriate if your driver is intended to run only on one type of autopilot board (As these depend on the previous operation's drivers). If you want it to run on multiple AP_HAL targets then you have two choices:</p>
<p>-Use a register</p>
<p>-Add a new HAL interface</p>
<h1></h1>
<h1>Ardupilot drivers versus platform drivers</h1>
<p>For Ardupilot, there are a MPU6000 driver in libraries/AP_InertalSensor/AP_InertialSensor_MPU6000.cpp, and another MPU6000 driver in PX4Firmware/src/drivers/mpu6000. The reason for this duplication is that the PX4 project already provides a set of <g class="gr_ gr_171 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="171" data-gr-id="171">well tested</g> drivers for hardware that comes with PX4 boards, and we enjoy a good collaborative relationship with the PX4 project on developing and enhancing these drivers. So when we build ArduPilot for PX4 we take advantage of the PX4 drivers by writing small &ldquo;shim&rdquo; drivers which present the PX4 drivers with the standard ArduPilot library interface. If you look at libraries/AP_InertialSensor/AP_InertialSensor_PX4.cpp you will see a small shim driver that asks the PX4 what IMU drivers are available on this board and automatically makes all of them available as part of the ArduPilot AP_InertialSensor library. So if we have an MPU6000 on the board we use the AP_InertialSensor_MPU6000.cpp driver on non-PX4 <g class="gr_ gr_175 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="175" data-gr-id="175">platforms,</g> and the AP_InertialSensor_PX4.cpp driver on PX4 based platforms. The same type of split can also happen for other AP_HAL ports. For example, we could use Linux kernel drivers for some sensors on Linux boards. For other <g class="gr_ gr_177 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="177" data-gr-id="177">sensors</g> we use the generic AP_HAL I2C and SPI interfaces to use the ArduPilot &ldquo;in-tree&rdquo; drivers which work across a wide range of boards.</p>
<h1></h1>
<h1>The AP_Scheduler system</h1>
<p>The AP_Scheduler library is used to divide up time within the main vehicle <g class="gr_ gr_167 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="167" data-gr-id="167">thread,</g> while providing some simple mechanisms to control how much time is used for each operation (called a &lsquo;task&rsquo; in AP_Scheduler). The way it works is that the loop() function for each vehicle implementation contains some code that does this:</p>
<p>-Wait for a new IMU (Inertial measurement unit, so basically all the flight data stuff) sample to arrive</p>
<p>-Call a set of tasks between each IMU sample</p>
<p>Table driven design: In many programs, there is a need to deal with entities whose handling requires a variety of distinct behaviors. A straight-forward approach to algorithm design deals with the different kinds of entities using case statements or extended if-then-else statements. However, if the number of types of the entities is large then this approach lead to large amounts of code, often with poor <g class="gr_ gr_136 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="136" data-gr-id="136">run time</g> characteristics. A table driven approach uses tables to classify the different kinds of entities, aiming at a reduction of the number of cases requiring distinct code.</p>
<p>It is a <g class="gr_ gr_109 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="109" data-gr-id="109">table driven</g> scheduler, and each vehicle type has <g class="gr_ gr_113 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="113" data-gr-id="113">a <g class="gr_ gr_114 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style replaceWithoutSep" id="114" data-gr-id="114">AP_Scheduler::Task</g></g> table.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>static const AP_Scheduler::Task scheduler_tasks[]</p>
<p>PROGMEM <b>=</b> {<br />&nbsp;{ ins_update, 1, 1000 },<br />&nbsp;{ one_hz_print, 50, 1000 },<br />&nbsp;{ five_second_call, 250, 1800 },<br />};</p>
<p>The first number after each function name is the call frequency, in units controlled by the ins.init() call. For this example sketch the ins.init() uses RATE_50HZ, so each scheduling step is 20ms. That means the ins_update() call is made every 20ms, the one_hz_print() function is called every 50 times (ie. once a second) and the five_second_call() is called every 250 times (ie. once every 5 seconds).</p>
<p>The third number is the maximum time that the function is expected to take. This is used to avoid making the call unless there is enough time left in this scheduling run to run the function. When scheduler.run() is called it is passed the amount of time (in microseconds) available for running tasks, and if the worst case time for this task would mean it wouldn&rsquo;t fit before that time runs out then it won&rsquo;t be called.</p>
<p>Metronome: Ticks that marks time at a selected rate by giving a regular tick</p>
<p>ins.wait_for_sample() is a function call for Ardupilot that serves as a metronome. It blocks execution of the main vehicle thread until a new IMU sample is available. The time between IMU samples is controlled by the arguments to the ins.init() call. So the drone would not fly when it cannot receive IMU samples. This is metronome as there is a "maximum timer" that limits the time available for running task.</p>
<p>Note that tasks in AP_Scheduler tables must have the following attributes:</p>
<p>-they should never block (except for the ins.update() call until new IMU samples are acquired)</p>
<p>-they should never call sleep functions when flying (a drone, like a real pilot, should never sleep while flying)</p>
<p>-they should have predictable worst case timing (Predictable=reliable)</p>
<h1></h1>
<h1>Semaphores</h1>
<p>When you have multiple threads (or timer callbacks) you need to ensure that data structures shared by the two logical threads of execution are updated in a way that prevents corruption. There are 3 principle ways of doing this in ArduPilot - semaphores, lockless data <g class="gr_ gr_192 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="192" data-gr-id="192">structures</g> and the PX4 ORB.</p>
<p>Semaphore: Think of semaphores as bouncers at a nightclub. There are a dedicated number of people that are allowed in the club at once. If the club is full no one is allowed to enter, but as soon as one person leaves another person might enter. It's simply a way to limit the number of consumers for a specific resource. For example, to limit the number of simultaneous calls to a database in an application.</p>
<p>AP_HAL Semaphores are just wrappers around whatever semaphore system is available on the specific <g class="gr_ gr_214 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="214" data-gr-id="214">platform,</g> and provide a simple mechanism for mutual exclusion. For example, I2C drivers can ask for the I2C bus semaphore to ensure that only one I2C device is used at a time. So it uses the innate semaphores but specializes it for a specific Ardupilot hardware/use.</p>

<h1>Lockless data structure[caption width="564" id="attachment_404" align="alignnone"]<img src="http://rcnode.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/lockless.png" width="564" height="218" alt="" class="wp-image-404 size-full" /> Image from http://preshing.com/20120612/an-introduction-to-lock-free-programming/[/caption]</h1>
<p>Mutex: A program object that is created so that multiple program thread can take turns sharing the same resource, such as access to a file.</p>
<p>So lockless data structure are codes that <g class="gr_ gr_254 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="254" data-gr-id="254">prevents</g> a thread blocking out another thread. The ArduPilot code also contains examples of using lockless data structures to avoid the need for a semaphore. This can be a lot more efficient than semaphores.</p>
<h1></h1>
<h1>The PX4 ORB</h1>
<p>Another example of this type of mechanism is the PX4 ORB. The ORB (Object Request Broker) is a way of providing data from one part of the system to another (eg. device driver -&gt; vehicle code) using a publish/subscribe model that is safe in a multi-threaded environment. The ORB provides a nice mechanism for declaring structures which will be shared in this way, code can then &ldquo;publish&rdquo; data to one of these topics, which is picked up by other pieces of code. This allows for control over when the threads are executed.</p>[/et_pb_text][et_pb_divider show_divider="on" _builder_version="3.0.51" color="#000000" divider_weight="2px"][/et_pb_divider][et_pb_comments _builder_version="3.0.51"][/et_pb_comments][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row][/et_pb_section]
